# Contributing to Agent Memory Protocol

Thank you for your interest in AMP! This is an open standard and community input makes it better.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Feedback on the Specification

Found something unclear? Have a use case that isn't covered? Think we got something wrong?

- **Open an issue** describing the problem or suggestion
- **Be specific** — include examples where possible
- **Consider backwards compatibility** — breaking changes need strong justification

### 2. Implementations

Built an AMP-compliant server or client? Awesome!

1. Ensure it passes the compliance tests (coming soon)
2. Open a PR to add it to the implementations table in README.md
3. Include: name, language/stack, link, and any notable features

### 3. Extensions

AMP is intentionally minimal. Domain-specific extensions are welcome:

- **Propose via issue first** — discuss before implementing
- **Document clearly** — extensions should have the same clarity as core spec
- **Namespace appropriately** — use `x-yourname-feature` for experimental fields

### 4. Documentation

- Improve explanations
- Add examples
- Fix typos
- Translate to other languages

## Development Process

1. **Discuss** — Open an issue for significant changes
2. **Draft** — Create a PR with proposed changes
3. **Review** — Community and maintainers provide feedback
4. **Revise** — Iterate based on feedback
5. **Merge** — Accepted changes go into the next spec version

## Spec Versioning

- **Draft** (v0.x) — Subject to breaking changes based on feedback
- **Stable** (v1.x+) — Breaking changes only in major versions

We're currently in **draft**. Now is the best time to influence the design.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. Be constructive. Assume good intent. We're all trying to make agent memory better.
